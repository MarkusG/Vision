# Vision
Albion Vision Project

The Albion Vision Project is a WIP project to document what packets are sent between Albion and the Client.

# Installation
Download, Clone, Open in Visual Studio

**Put the following .dll's in the libs folder** (You will need to get them on your own, they are not too hard to get)
* PcapDotNet.Base.dll
* PcapDotNet.Core.dll
* PcapDotNet.Core.Extensiond.dll
* PcapDotNet.Packets.dll
* Photon3DotNet.dll
* Photon3Unity3D.dll

I've found that only Pcap version 1.0.4.1 works. So if you're having issues use that version.

# Legal

This is based off [AO-Radar](https://github.com/rafalfigura/AO-Radar) (which i have to mention due to GPL license). **The radar completley removed and is 100% unaccessable in this program**. 


### Is this allowed?

Offically SBI allows the reading of packet data on the following conditions:

```
Our position is quite simple. As long as you just look and analyze we are ok with it. The moment you modify or manipulate something or somehow interfere with our services we will react (e.g. perma-ban, take legal action, whatever
```
- Mad Dave, Technical Lead at SBI 

Many people take this as an OK to create cheating tools.

The TOS also mentions the following:

```
In particular users are forbidden to...

create or use cheats, mods and/or hacks as well as any other third party software that modifies the gaming experience of the Game unless permitted by the rules of the Game,
```

So by TOS and general ethics about cheating == bad this project's full intention is researching how the game works, finding bugs, and hopefully preventing tools like the one that this project is based on from working.
